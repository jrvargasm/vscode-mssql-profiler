## Overview

SQL Server Profiler for VS Code brings powerful database profiling capabilities directly into your development environment. Built with React and TypeScript, it leverages SQL Server's Extended Events system to capture and analyze database activity in real-time.

## Features

### 🎯 Core Profiling Capabilities
- **Real-time Event Monitoring**: Capture SQL statements, stored procedures, and database events as they happen
- **Multiple Session Templates**: Pre-configured templates for Standard, TSQL, and Azure SQL profiling
- **Extended Events (XEvents)**: Uses SQL Server's modern profiling infrastructure
- **Live Event Updates**: Events refresh every 2 seconds with minimal performance impact
- **Database Context**: Automatic database name resolution using `sys.databases` for accurate filtering

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **React-based Webview**: Fast, responsive interface with VS Code theme integration
- **Event Details Panel**: Click any event to see all captured fields with copy functionality
- **Copy to Clipboard**:
  - Copy individual field values with one click
  - Copy entire events as formatted JSON
  - Hover-to-reveal copy buttons for clean UI

### 🔍 Advanced Filtering
- **Multi-select Database Filter**: Filter events by one or more databases simultaneously
- **Event Type Filter**: Show only specific event types (batch_completed, rpc_completed, etc.)
- **Text Search**: Search across all event fields in real-time
- **Smart Dropdowns**: Click outside to close, visual selection counts
- **Auto-select All**: Databases are selected by default on session start

### 📊 Event Grid
- **Sortable Columns**: Click any column header to sort
- **Adaptive Columns**: Grid shows only columns with data for your events
- **Performance Metrics**: Duration, CPU time, reads, writes, row counts
- **Event Count Display**: See total events and max event limit

### 🔌 Connection Management
- **Activity Bar Integration**: Dedicated sidebar with Connections and Active Sessions views
- **Saved Connection Profiles**: Store frequently used connections
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Passwords stored in VS Code's secret storage
- **Quick Actions**: Start profiling from any saved connection with one click
- **Connection Editor**: Edit server, database, credentials, or authentication type
- **mssql Extension Integration**: Automatically detects and uses existing mssql connections

### 🎮 Session Control
- **Toolbar Actions**: Start, Stop, Pause, Clear, Export, and Reconnect buttons
- **Visual State Indicators**: Animated running state, color-coded status
- **Auto-start Option**: Automatically begin profiling when session is created
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions remain active until explicitly stopped
- **Error Recovery**: Reconnect on connection failures with multiple retry options

### 📁 Active Sessions View
- **Live Session List**: See all running profiler sessions in the sidebar
- **Real-time Updates**: Event counts and session states update automatically
- **Color-coded Icons**:
  - 🟢 Green for running sessions
  - 🟡 Yellow for paused sessions
  - 🔴 Red for stopped sessions
- **Connection Info**: Shows server/database for each session

### ⚙️ Configurable Settings
- `mssql-profiler.maxEvents`: Maximum events to display (default: 1000)
- `mssql-profiler.autoStartSession`: Auto-start after creation (default: true)
- `mssql-profiler.connectionProfiles`: Saved connection profiles (managed via UI)

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code**: 1.85.0 or higher
- **SQL Server**: 2012 or higher (2016+ recommended for best XEvents support)
- **Azure SQL Database**: Fully supported with Azure-specific templates
- **Permissions**: `ALTER ANY EVENT SESSION` permission on the server/database

### Build Configuration

**Extension Build**: TypeScript compilation (`tsc`)
- Source: `src/**/*.ts` (excluding webview)
- Output: `out/` directory
- Config: `tsconfig.json`

**Webview Build**: Webpack + React
- Entry: `src/webview/index.tsx`
- Output: `out/webview/webview.js`
- Config: `webpack.config.js`
- Production build minifies and optimizes React bundle

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### Extended Events (XEvents)

The extension uses SQL Server Extended Events, the modern replacement for SQL Trace:

1. **Session Creation**: Creates XEvent session with ring buffer target
2. **Event Collection**: Polls ring buffer every 2 seconds for new events
3. **XML Parsing**: Parses XEvent XML data into structured events
4. **Database Resolution**: Queries `sys.databases` to map database IDs to names
5. **Event Display**: Renders events in React-based grid with filtering

### Communication Flow

```
VS Code Extension (Node.js)

ProfilerService (mssql npm package)
    ↓
SQL Server Extended Events
    ↓
Ring Buffer Target (XML)
    ↓
Webview Panel (React)
```

### Key Technologies

- **Backend**: TypeScript, Node.js, mssql npm package
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, CSS
- **VS Code APIs**: Webview API, TreeView API, Secret Storage API
- **Database**: SQL Server Extended Events, sys.databases

## Templates

### Standard Template
Captures common database events with performance metrics:
- `sql_batch_completed` - SQL batch execution
- `rpc_completed` - Stored procedure calls
- `attention` - Query cancellations
- `existing_connection` - Connection tracking
- `login` and `logout` - Authentication events

### TSQL Template
Focused on T-SQL statement execution:
- `sql_statement_completed` - Individual statement execution
- `sql_batch_completed` - Batch execution
- Includes statement text, duration, CPU, and I/O metrics

### Standard_Azure Template
Optimized for Azure SQL Database:
- Same events as Standard template
- Uses database-scoped event sessions
- Compatible with Azure SQL Database limitations

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create profiler session"
- **Check Permissions**: User needs `ALTER ANY EVENT SESSION` permission
- **Azure SQL**: Ensure using Standard_Azure template, not Standard
- **Session Already Exists**: Drop the session manually or use a different name

### "No events appearing"
- **Check Filters**: Ensure databases/event types are selected
- **Verify Activity**: Run queries on the monitored database
- **Connection Issues**: Use the Reconnect button if connection was lost

### "Database filter shows wrong values"
- This was fixed by querying `sys.databases` directly
- Update to latest version if you see this issue

### Events not updating
- Events refresh every 2 seconds automatically
- Check Active Sessions view to verify session is running (green icon)
- Stop and restart the session if needed

## Known Limitations

- Maximum events limited by configuration (default 1000)
- Ring buffer is memory-limited - very high activity may lose events
- Some Extended Event fields may not be available in all SQL Server versions
- Azure SQL Database requires database-scoped sessions (not server-scoped)
